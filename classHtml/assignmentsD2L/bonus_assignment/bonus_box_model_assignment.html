		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>The circumference (from Latin circumferentia, meaning "carrying around") 
		of a closed curve or circular object is the linear distance around its edge.
		The circumference of a circle is of special importance in geometry and 
		trigonometry. Informally "circumference" may also refer to the edge itself 
		rather than to the length of the edge. Circumference is a special case of 
		perimeter: the perimeter is the length around any closed figure, but 
		conventionally "perimeter" is typically used in reference to a polygon while 
		"circumference" typically refers to a continuously differentiable curve.</p>

		<p>In geometry, the radius of a circle or sphere is the shortest connection 
		between the center and the boundary. It is half of the diameter.

		<br><br>
		r = d รท 2
		
		<br><br>
		d = 2 x r = d = r + r
		
		<br><br>
		r = Radius d= Diameter

		<br><br>
		The relationship between the radius r and the circumference 
		c of a circle is c = 2 * pi * r .

		<br><br>
		The area A of a circle of radius r is 
		A =  pi * r^2.
		<br><br>

		<h2>Area</h2>	
		<p>Area is the amount of space a two dimensional (flat) surface takes up. 
		It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a 
		hollow container; for example, how much wood is needed to make a wardrobe.<br><br>

		You can use different formulas to find the area of different shapes.<br><br>

		Area of a rectangle is the length of any two touching sides multiplied together. 
		In other words, length times width.<br><br>
		Area of a triangle is half of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height. 
		This can be found using the trigonometry formula, A = 1/2 * a * b * sin c..<br><br>
		Area of a circle: A = pi * r^2.<br><br>
		The area of a flat object is related to the surface area and volume of a three-dimensional object.<br><br>

		The area under a curve can be found using integration, from calculus.<br><br>

		Some units used to measure area are square mile and square kilometre.</p><br>

		<br>
		
		<h2>Diameter</h2>
		<p>In geometry, the diameter of a circle is a line from one side directly 
		to the opposite side through the centre. It can also be defined as the 
		longest chord of a circle. These can both describe the diameter in a sphere too.<br><br>

		The letter d is often used as a symbol for the diameter. The diameter's length 
		is often called the diameter itself.<br><br>

		The diameter's length is twice the radius, and therefore the relationship 
		between the diameter's length and radius can be shown with the equations:<br><br>

		d = 2r and r = d / 2<br><br>

		Here is the wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter">link</a>.</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Radian</h2>	
		<p>A radian is a unit of measuring angles. 
		It is shown by the symbol "rad" or, less often, c (for circular measure). 
		The radian was once an SI unit, but was done away with in 1995.<br><br>

		A "milliradian" is 1/1000 of a radian.	<br><br>
		Here is the wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">link</a>.</p>
		<br>
		

		<h2>Who uses Radians?</h2>
		<p>Most people who do mathematics or physics use radians, 
		rather than degrees, because some kinds of calculations are simpler 
		when using radians rather than degrees.<br><br>

		People who look through a telescope or rifle scope often use milliradians to describe distances as seen through it.<br><br>

		This unit of measurement is often used in the universe of the popular video game Mass Effect in relations to physics.<br><br>
