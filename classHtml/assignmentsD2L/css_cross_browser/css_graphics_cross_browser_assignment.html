		and other relevant bits about my professional life.  Book editors always like it if 
		you can write something personal too.  I dislike book editors.</p>

		<h2>My first important language</h2>	
		<p>Here is a paragraph about a programming language that I like.  Hmm.  Pascal?  No.
		Pascal is ok.  How about HTML?  CSS?  JavaScript?  Maybe.  But "like" is a strong word.

		<p>Another time I wrote about programming languages was right here.</p>	
		<h2>The third thing I did</h2>	
		<p>Here is some more information about something else that I have done.</p>	
		<h2>Another thing I did</h2>
